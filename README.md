# EEGClassification
essential blocks for eeg encoder is defined under layers module spacial , emporal and residual block are used to build an eeg encoder, finally flatening the features to map into a 128 dimentional latant space
an image encoder is built using convolution layers to extract features from the images and map it into a 128 dim latant space
